In Python, keywords are reserved words that have a predefined meaning and cannot be used as identifiers \n(such as variable names, function names, or class names).

The first character must be a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_):\n2. After the first character, an identifier can contain letters (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), or underscores.\n3.

Provide an example.\n\n\"\"\"\nAns3. In Python, comments are used to annotate the code with explanatory text. They are not executed by the Python interpreter, meaning they have no effect on the program's behavior. Comments are purely for human readers and help explain what the code does, why certain decisions were made, or to provide other contextual information.\n\nThere are two types of comments in Python:\n\nSingle-line comments: These are used for brief explanations. A single-line comment begins with the hash (#) symbol.\nMulti-line comments: These are typically used for longer explanations or documentation and are enclosed by triple quotes (''' or \"\"\").\n\n\"\"\"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Examples:\n\n# This is a single-line comment\nx = 10  # Assigning 10 to variable x\n\n'''\nThis is a multi-line comment.\nYou can use this to write longer explanations or documentation.\n'''\ny=20\nprint(x+y)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-03-12T11:25:56.864645Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-03-12T11:25:56.864997Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-03-12T11:25:56.871236Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-03-12T11:25:56.864965Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-03-12T11:25:56.870398Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"30\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":1},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\"\"\"\nQue4. Why is proper indentation important in Python?\n\nAns4. In Python, indentation is not just for readability â€” it plays a crucial role in defining the structure and flow of the code. Unlike many other programming languages that \nuse braces {} or other delimiters to define blocks of code, Python relies on indentation to indicate the grouping of statements. This is known as off-side rule.\n\nWhy is it important?\n\nProper indentation ensures that Python can interpret which code belongs to which block.\nIt improves readability and avoids syntax errors like IndentationError.\n\"\"\"\n","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\"\"\"\nQue5. What happens if indentation is incorrect in Python?\nAns5. If indentation is incorrect in Python, it leads to errors because Python relies on indentation to define the structure of the code. Python uses indentation to group \nstatements into blocks. Therefore, incorrect indentation can cause Python to misinterpret the structure of the program, resulting in errors or unexpected behavior.\n\nFor example:\n\"\"\"\n","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def greet(name):\n     if name:  # Correct indentation\n         print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n    else:  # Incorrect indentation\n        print(\"Hello, Stranger!\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-03-12T11:32:06.299295Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-03-12T11:32:06.299678Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-03-12T11:32:06.306142Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-03-12T11:32:06.299647Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-03-12T11:32:06.304466Z"}},"outputs":[{"traceback":["\u001b[0;36m  File \u001b[0;32m\"<tokenize>\"\u001b[0;36m, line \u001b[0;32m4\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;31m    else:  # Incorrect indentation\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m    ^\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;31mIndentationError\u001b[0m\u001b[0;31m:\u001b[0m unindent does not match any outer indentation level\n"],"ename":"IndentationError","evalue":"unindent does not match any outer indentation level (<tokenize>, line 4)","output_type":"error"}],"execution_count":3},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\"\"\"\nQue6. Differentiate between expression and statement in Python with examples.\n\nAn expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and function calls that Python evaluates to produce a result (usually a value). Expressions return a value and \ncan be used wherever Python expects a value.\n\nKey Points about Expressions:\nAn expression can be a simple value like a number or a variable.\nIt always evaluates to a result.\nIt can involve operations, function calls, or logical evaluations.\n\nA statement is a line of code that performs some action. Unlike an expression, a statement doesn't return a value; instead, it carries out an operation or produces side effects, such as changing a variable's value, printing something to the screen, or controlling the flow of the program (e.g., if, while, for, etc.).\n\nKey Points about Statements:\nA statement represents an instruction that Python will execute.\nIt does not return a value like an expression.\nStatements typically control the flow of the program or perform actions.\n\"\"\"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Example:\n\nx = 10  # Statement (assignment)\ny = x + 5  # Expression (x + 5 evaluates to 15, and assigns it to y)\nif y > 10:  # Statement (conditional)\n    print(\"y is greater than 10\")  # Statement (action)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-03-12T11:36:26.928896Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-03-12T11:36:26.929240Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-03-12T11:36:26.934454Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-03-12T11:36:26.929212Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-03-12T11:36:26.933429Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"y is greater than 10\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":4}]}
